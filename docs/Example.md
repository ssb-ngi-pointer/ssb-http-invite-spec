# Example

Suppose the client has the SSB ID `@FlieaFef19uJ6jhHwv2CSkFrDLYKJd/SuIS71A5Y2as=.ed25519` and the server is hosted at `scuttlebutt.eu`. Then the invite user journey is:

1. Invite code `39c0ac1850ec9af14f1bb73` was generated by the server
1. The corresponding invite link is `https://scuttlebutt.eu/join?invite=39c0ac1850ec9af14f1bb73`
1. When the client opens that link in a browser, it renders a link to the SSB URI [ssb:experimental?action=claim-http-invite&invite=39c0ac1850ec9af14f1bb73&postTo=https%3A%2F%2Fscuttlebutt.eu%2Fclaiminvite](ssb:experimental?action=claim-http-invite&invite=39c0ac1850ec9af14f1bb73&postTo=https%3A%2F%2Fscuttlebutt.eu%2Fclaiminvite)
1. The client's SSB app processes the SSB URI and makes a POST request to `https://scuttlebutt.eu/claiminvite` with body
    ```
    {
      "id": "@FlieaFef19uJ6jhHwv2CSkFrDLYKJd/SuIS71A5Y2as=.ed25519",
      "invite": "39c0ac1850ec9af14f1bb73"
    }
    ```
1. The server accepts the POST request, and responds with the JSON body
    ```
    {
      "status": "successful",
      "multiserverAddress": "net:scuttlebutt.eu:8008~shs:zz+n7zuFc4wofIgKeEpXgB+/XQZB43Xj2rrWyD0QM2M="
    }
    ```
1. The server now recognizes the client as an authorized member for any subsequent secret-handshake and muxrpc connections at the multiserver address `net:scuttlebutt.eu:8008~shs:zz+n7zuFc4wofIgKeEpXgB+/XQZB43Xj2rrWyD0QM2M=`

The JSON endpoint `https://scuttlebutt.eu/join?invite=39c0ac1850ec9af14f1bb73&encoding=json` is an alternative to the SSB URI, and would respond with the following JSON:

```json
{
  "status": "successful",
  "invite": "39c0ac1850ec9af14f1bb73",
  "postTo": "https://scuttlebutt.eu/claiminvite"
}
```

After that, the same steps 4, 5, and 6 apply.
